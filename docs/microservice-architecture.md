# Microservice Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the internal architecture of our microservices. It provides a blueprint for building domain-driven, event-sourced microservices using a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Architectural Principles

Our microservices follow these key architectural principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Focusing on the core domain and domain logic
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separating read and write operations
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing all changes to application state as a sequence of events
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Isolating the domain core from external concerns
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensuring that business rules don't depend on external frameworks or tools

## Layered Architecture

The microservice is organized into the following layers:

### 1. Domain Layer

The domain layer is the core of the application, containing the business logic and rules.

#### Components:

- **Entities**: Domain objects with identity and lifecycle
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of domain objects treated as a single unit
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity
- **Domain Events**: Immutable records of something that happened in the domain
- **Repository Interfaces**: Abstractions for data access
- **Domain Services**: Operations that don't naturally fit within an entity or value object
- **Domain Exceptions**: Custom exceptions specific to domain rules

### 2. Application Layer

The application layer orchestrates the flow of data to and from the domain layer and coordinates business logic.

#### Components:

- **Commands**: Immutable data structures representing an intent to change the system state
- **Command Handlers**: Process commands and apply business logic
- **Queries**: Immutable data structures representing a request for information
- **Query Handlers**: Process queries and return data
- **Application Services**: Coordinate complex operations across multiple aggregates

### 3. Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides implementations for interfaces defined in the domain layer.

#### Components:

- **Repository Implementations**: Concrete implementations of repository interfaces
- **External Service Integrations**: Adapters for external services
- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Database access code
- **Message Brokers**: Implementation of event publishing and subscription

### 4. Presentation Layer

The presentation layer handles HTTP requests and responses.

#### Components:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and delegate to the application layer
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Structures for data exchange with clients
- **Validators**: Validate incoming data
- **Filters**: Process requests and responses

## Flow of Control

### Command Flow (Write Operations)

1. The client sends a request to a controller
2. The controller creates a command and sends it to the command bus
3. The command bus routes the command to the appropriate command handler
4. The command handler:
   - Retrieves the aggregate from the repository (if updating)
   - Creates a new aggregate (if creating)
   - Applies business logic
   - Applies domain events to the aggregate
   - Saves the aggregate to the repository
5. Domain events are published to the event bus
6. Event handlers process the events (e.g., updating read models, triggering side effects)

### Query Flow (Read Operations)

1. The client sends a request to a controller
2. The controller creates a query and sends it to the query bus
3. The query bus routes the query to the appropriate query handler
4. The query handler retrieves data from the repository or read model
5. The data is returned to the client

## Event Sourcing

Our microservices use event sourcing to maintain a complete history of all changes to the application state.

### Key Concepts:

- **Event Store**: Persistent storage for domain events
- **Event Stream**: Sequence of events for a specific aggregate
- **Event Replay**: Reconstructing the current state by replaying events
- **Snapshots**: Periodic captures of aggregate state to optimize loading

### Event Flow:

1. Domain events are applied to aggregates
2. Events are persisted to the event store
3. Events are published to the event bus
4. Event handlers process events to update read models or trigger side effects
5. Other microservices can subscribe to events to maintain their own state

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

The repository pattern provides a collection-like interface for accessing domain aggregates:

- **Interface**: Defined in the domain layer
- **Implementation**: Provided in the infrastructure layer
- **Purpose**: Abstract data access details from the domain layer

### Factory Pattern

The factory pattern is used to create complex domain objects:

- **Static Factory Methods**: Methods like `create()` on entities and aggregates
- **Purpose**: Encapsulate creation logic and ensure valid object state

### Aggregate Pattern

The aggregate pattern defines consistency boundaries:

- **Aggregate Root**: The entry point to the aggregate
- **Invariants**: Business rules that must be maintained
- **Purpose**: Ensure transactional consistency

### Command Pattern

The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object:

- **Command**: Data structure representing an intent
- **Command Handler**: Processes the command
- **Purpose**: Decouple request from execution

### Query Pattern

The query pattern encapsulates a data request:

- **Query**: Data structure representing a request for information
- **Query Handler**: Processes the query
- **Purpose**: Decouple data retrieval from presentation

## Best Practices

### Domain Layer

- Keep the domain layer free of infrastructure concerns
- Use rich domain models with behavior
- Encapsulate business rules in entities and aggregates
- Use value objects for concepts without identity
- Define clear aggregate boundaries

### Application Layer

- Keep command handlers focused on a single responsibility
- Use the command bus for write operations
- Use the query bus for read operations
- Validate commands before processing
- Return DTOs, not domain objects

### Infrastructure Layer

- Implement repositories using the ORM or data access technology of choice
- Use dependency injection to provide implementations
- Handle infrastructure-specific exceptions and translate to domain exceptions
- Implement optimistic concurrency control for updates

### Presentation Layer

- Keep controllers thin, delegating to the application layer
- Use DTOs for data exchange with clients
- Validate incoming data
- Handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP status codes

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and testable microservices. By following these patterns and practices, we can create microservices that are:

- **Focused**: Each microservice has a clear responsibility
- **Independent**: Microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Resilient**: Failures are isolated to individual microservices
- **Scalable**: Microservices can be scaled based on their specific requirements
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and modify
